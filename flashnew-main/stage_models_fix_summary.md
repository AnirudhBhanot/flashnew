# Stage Models Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Successfully resolved the missing model files issue for stage-based hierarchical models.

## Problems Found and Fixed:

1. **Model Naming Mismatch**
   - The code was looking for `series_c_plus_model.pkl` but the file was named `series_c_model.pkl`
   - Created a symbolic link to resolve this

2. **Feature Mismatch**
   - Stage models were trained with 44 features (without `funding_stage`)
   - The code was trying to pass 45 features including `funding_stage`
   - Created `stage_model_features.py` to define the correct 44 features

3. **Categorical Feature Handling**
   - CatBoost models require categorical features to be strings
   - Updated `stage_hierarchical_models.py` to properly prepare features

4. **Model Loading Fallback**
   - Added robust fallback mechanism when hierarchical model can't be loaded
   - Falls back to loading individual stage models from `models/stage_hierarchical/`

## Files Modified/Created:

1. **`stage_hierarchical_models.py`**
   - Added `_prepare_features()` method to handle feature preparation
   - Updated model loading with better error handling and fallback
   - Fixed feature type conversions for CatBoost

2. **`stage_model_features.py`** (new)
   - Defines the 44 features expected by stage models
   - Specifies categorical and boolean features

3. **`fix_stage_models.py`** (new)
   - Utility script to create model wrappers
   - Provides fallback model creation if needed

4. **Symbolic Link Created**
   - `models/stage_hierarchical/series_c_plus_model.pkl` â†’ `series_c_model.pkl`

## Verification:
All 5 stage models are now loaded and working:
- pre_seed_model.pkl
- seed_model.pkl  
- series_a_model.pkl
- series_b_model.pkl
- series_c_plus_model.pkl (via symbolic link)

## Usage:
```python
from stage_hierarchical_models import StageHierarchicalModel

# Initialize and load models
stage_model = StageHierarchicalModel()
stage_model.load_models('models/stage_hierarchical')

# Make predictions
predictions = stage_model.predict(features_df)
probabilities = stage_model.predict_proba(features_df)
insights = stage_model.get_stage_insights(features_df)
```

The models now correctly handle:
- Stage-specific thresholds
- Feature preparation for CatBoost
- Fallback predictions when specific stage model unavailable
- Stage-specific insights and recommendations
