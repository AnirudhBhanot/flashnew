# Fix for Chunk Loading Error

## Problem
The React app is failing to load the Assessment page chunk with error:
```
Loading chunk src_pages_Assessment_index_tsx failed
```

## Solutions to Try:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 2. Delete node_modules and Reinstall
```bash
cd /Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/flash-frontend-apple
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Clear Webpack Cache
```bash
cd /Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/flash-frontend-apple
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm start
```

### 4. Check for Port Conflicts
Make sure no other process is using port 3000:
```bash
lsof -i :3000
# If something is running, kill it:
kill -9 <PID>
```

### 5. Update React Scripts (if needed)
```bash
npm update react-scripts
```

## Quick Fix (Try First):
Since the dev server just started, try:
1. Close all browser tabs with localhost:3000
2. Open a new incognito/private window
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. The chunks should load fresh

## If Still Not Working:
The issue might be with lazy loading. Check if the Assessment route is properly configured in the main App component.
