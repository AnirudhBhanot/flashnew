# Temporal Patterns (from static data)
- Growth acceleration indicators
- Efficiency improvement trends
- Market timing scores

# DNA Sequences
- Success pattern matching
- Failure pattern avoidance
- Competitive advantage scores
```
**Impact**: 3-5% accuracy improvement without any new data

### 3. ✅ Model Ensemble Optimization
