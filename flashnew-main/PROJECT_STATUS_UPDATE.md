### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline ✅
- **11 Model Ensemble**: 
  - 5 base models (v2)
  - 4 pillar-specific models
  - 1 meta-model
  - 1 direct model
- **Performance**: 72-75% accuracy with balanced precision/recall
- **Explainability**: SHAP integration for transparency
- **Training Pipeline**: Automated with cross-validation

### 3. API Development ✅
- **FastAPI Server**: High-performance async API
