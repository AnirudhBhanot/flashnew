## Auto-Calculation Logic

### Financial Calculations (Capital Page)
```javascript
// Runway calculation
runway = Math.floor(cashOnHand / monthlyBurn)

// Burn multiple calculation  
burnMultiple = (monthlyBurn / monthlyRevenue).toFixed(2)

// Annual revenue run rate
annualRevenueRunRate = monthlyRevenue * 12
```

### Market Calculations (Market Page)
```javascript
// SAM calculation (10% of TAM)
sam = Math.round(tam * 0.1)

// SOM calculation (1% of SAM)
som = Math.round(sam * 0.01)
```

## Data Transformation

The `transformAssessmentToAPI` function in `services/api.ts` handles:

1. **Type Conversion**: Booleans to 0/1, strings to numbers
2. **Percentage Handling**: Some fields need division by 100 (retention rates)
3. **Mapping**: Frontend values to API-expected values
4. **Validation**: Ensures all 45 features are present

## Validation Rules

- Numeric fields accept 0 as valid (except where noted)
- Percentage fields typically range 0-100
- Scale fields range 1-5
- Required fields vary by page (defined in each component's validate function)
