# Michelin Analysis Frontend Fix

## Issue
Frontend error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` at line 407 in MichelinStrategicAnalysis.tsx

## Root Cause
The decomposed Michelin analysis backend was not returning the `strategic_priorities` field in the SWOT analysis, but the frontend expected it and tried to map over it without a null check.

## Solution
Added `get_strategic_priorities` method to the decomposed analysis engine that:
1. Uses DeepSeek to generate 3 strategic priorities based on SWOT analysis
2. Falls back to intelligent defaults based on company metrics if API fails
3. Returns an array of priority strings

## Code Changes

### api_michelin_decomposed.py
```python
# Added method to generate strategic priorities
async def get_strategic_priorities(self, data: StartupData, swot_results: List) -> List[str]:
    """Generate strategic priorities based on SWOT analysis"""
    # ... implementation ...

# Updated Phase 1 analysis to include strategic priorities
"swot_analysis": {
    "strengths": swot_results[0],
    "weaknesses": swot_results[1],
    "opportunities": swot_results[2],
    "threats": swot_results[3],
    "strategic_priorities": await self.get_strategic_priorities(startup_data, swot_results)
},
```

## Testing
Confirmed all required fields are now present:
- ✅ executive_summary
- ✅ bcg_matrix_analysis (with position and strategic_implications)
- ✅ porters_five_forces
- ✅ swot_analysis (with strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, strategic_priorities)
- ✅ current_position_narrative

## Result
Frontend error is fixed. The Michelin Strategic Analysis component now receives all expected fields.

## Notes
There are still some structural differences in Phase 2 and Phase 3 between what the frontend expects and what the decomposed approach returns:
- Blue Ocean Strategy: Frontend expects `eliminate`, `reduce`, `raise`, `create` arrays, but decomposed returns `opportunities` array
- Growth Scenarios: Frontend expects different field names

These don't cause immediate errors due to optional chaining (`?.`), but may result in some sections appearing empty. A future enhancement would be to align these structures.
