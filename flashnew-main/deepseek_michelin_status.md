# DeepSeek Michelin Analysis Status Report

## Current Status
The Michelin analysis has been switched to use DeepSeek, but there are timeout issues with the API.

## What Was Done

1. **Created DeepSeek Adapter** (`api_michelin_deepseek_adapter.py`)
   - Connects frontend to the actual DeepSeek-powered Michelin analysis
   - Transforms DeepSeek responses to match frontend structure expectations
   - Handles timeouts gracefully (120s limit)
   - Maps between frontend and backend data models

2. **Updated API Server** (`api_server_unified.py`)
   - Replaced `frontend_fix_router` with `deepseek_adapter_router`
   - Now routes `/api/michelin/analyze` to DeepSeek implementation

3. **Fixed JSON Parsing** in `api_michelin_llm_analysis.py`
   - Increased max_tokens from 4000 to 8000
   - Enhanced JSON extraction logic to handle truncated responses
   - Added fallback for malformed JSON

## Current Issues

1. **Timeout Problems**
   - DeepSeek API calls are timing out (>120 seconds)
   - This could be due to:
     - DeepSeek API being slow/overloaded
     - Complex prompts requiring too much processing
     - Network issues

2. **Fallback Behavior**
   - When DeepSeek times out, the adapter returns a 504 error
   - Frontend should handle this gracefully

## Recommendations

1. **Short Term** (for immediate use):
   - Consider keeping the frontend fix implementation as a fallback
   - Add a feature flag to switch between DeepSeek and fallback
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls

2. **Medium Term**:
   - Optimize prompts to be more concise
   - Consider breaking the 3-phase analysis into separate API calls
   - Add progress indicators for long-running requests

3. **Long Term**:
   - Implement a queue system for DeepSeek requests
   - Consider using a different LLM provider as backup
   - Build a hybrid system that uses cached/pre-computed analysis

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test DeepSeek endpoint (may timeout)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/michelin/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startup_data": {
      "startup_name": "TestCo",
      "sector": "saas",
      "funding_stage": "seed",
      "total_capital_raised_usd": 2000000,
      "cash_on_hand_usd": 1000000,
      "market_size_usd": 5000000000,
      "market_growth_rate_annual": 25,
      "competitor_count": 10,
      "market_share_percentage": 0.5,
      "team_size_full_time": 15
    }
  }'

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/api_michelin_deepseek_adapter.py` - NEW: Adapter implementation
2. `/Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/api_server_unified.py` - Updated imports to use adapter
3. `/Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/api_michelin_llm_analysis.py` - Enhanced JSON parsing

## Next Steps

The user requested to "switch to using the deepseek for michelin analysis at all times". This has been implemented, but the DeepSeek API is experiencing timeout issues. The system is now configured to use DeepSeek, but may need additional optimization or a hybrid approach to handle the performance issues.
