# Remaining Issues in FLASH V16.2

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Status**: System functional but several issues need attention

## 1. Frontend Issues

### Sector Validation
- **Issue**: "proptech" sector causes validation error
- **Error**: `sector must be one of ['saas', 'fintech', 'healthtech', 'edtech', 'ecommerce', 'marketplace', 'deeptech', 'consumer', 'enterprise', 'other'] (got proptech)`
- **Fix needed**: Either add 'proptech' to allowed sectors or map it to 'other' in transformDataForAPI

### Missing Field Mappings
Several fields may still need transformation mappings:
- Additional sectors not in the current list
- Edge cases in investor tier naming
- Product stage variations

## 2. What-If Analysis Issues

### Score Calculation Logic
- **Issue**: The what-if analysis needs to show realistic score improvements
- **Current**: Shows improvements but logic may be too simplistic
- **Needed**: More sophisticated modeling of how improvements affect scores

### Implementation Concerns
```python
# Current prompt asks LLM to predict new scores
# But LLM may not have good understanding of score calculation
# Consider hybrid approach:
1. Use LLM for qualitative insights
2. Use ML models for quantitative score changes
```

## 3. API Endpoint Issues

### Test Failures
From test_llm_integration.py results:
- `get_dynamic_recommendations()` missing background_tasks parameter
- What-if endpoint expects different data structure
- Need to fix function signatures

### Error Handling
- 500 errors should return proper error messages
- Validation errors should be more user-friendly

## 4. Performance Issues

### LLM Response Times
- 15-20 seconds is long for user experience
- Consider:
  - Adding loading indicators
  - Implementing streaming responses
  - Pre-generating common recommendations

### Redis Caching
- Currently disabled (connection refused)
- Would significantly improve response times
- Need to either:
  - Set up Redis properly
  - Implement file-based caching
  - Use in-memory caching

## 5. Data Quality Issues

### Model Performance
- 50% AUC means predictions are barely better than random
- While "honest", this provides limited business value
- Consider:
  - Collecting more real data
  - Feature engineering improvements
  - Different modeling approaches

### Missing Data Handling
- 25% missing data in early stages
- Need better imputation strategies
- Consider stage-specific models

## 6. Testing Gaps

### Integration Tests
- Need more comprehensive integration tests
- Test edge cases in data transformation
- Test error scenarios

### Frontend-Backend Contract
- Ensure all field mappings are tested
- Test with various sector/stage combinations
- Validate all response formats

## 7. Documentation Issues

### API Documentation
- Need OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- Document all field transformations
- Provide more examples

### User Documentation
- How to interpret 50% success probability
- What the CAMP scores mean
- How to use what-if analysis effectively

## 8. Security Concerns

### API Key in Code
- DeepSeek API key hardcoded
- Should use environment variables
- Need key rotation strategy

### Input Validation
- Ensure all inputs are sanitized
- Prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting needed

## 9. Feature Requests

### Enhanced What-If
- Multiple scenario comparison
- Sensitivity analysis
- Monte Carlo simulations

### Better Visualizations
- Show uncertainty ranges
- Comparative analysis
- Historical trends

## 10. Code Quality

### Technical Debt
- Many deprecated Pydantic warnings
- Inconsistent error handling
- Magic numbers in code

### Refactoring Needs
- Extract constants
- Improve type hints
- Better separation of concerns

## Priority Fixes

### High Priority
1. Fix sector validation (add missing sectors)
2. Fix what-if score calculation logic
3. Fix API endpoint signatures
4. Add proper error messages

### Medium Priority
1. Set up Redis caching
2. Improve LLM response times
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Fix deprecated warnings

### Low Priority
1. Enhanced features
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code refactoring

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix validation errors blocking users
2. **This Week**: Fix what-if analysis to show meaningful improvements
3. **This Month**: Improve model performance with better data
4. **Long Term**: Build comprehensive testing and monitoring

## Notes

The system is functional and provides personalized recommendations, but these issues prevent it from being truly production-ready. The most critical issues are around data validation and what-if analysis accuracy.
