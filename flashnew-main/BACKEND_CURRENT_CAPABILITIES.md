  - Less than 3 months runway
  - Burning >5x revenue
  - Over 80% customer concentration
  - Monthly churn >20%
  - Single founder with key person risk
- Risk factors included in response

### 2. **Success Probability with Context** ✅
- Success probability (0-1) provided
- Confidence intervals included
- Stage-based thresholds for context
- Verdict system: "STRONG PASS", "PASS", "CONDITIONAL PASS", "FAIL", "STRONG FAIL"

### 3. **CAMP Pillar Scores** ✅
- Individual scores for Capital, Advantage, Market, People
- Stage-based weighting applied
- Risk-adjusted scoring implemented
- Below threshold detection

### 4. **Key Insights** ✅
- `key_insights` field in response
- Contextual insights based on data
- Critical failures highlighted
- Strengths and weaknesses identified

### 5. **Model Consensus** ✅ (But Hidden from Users)
- `model_consensus` data available
- Shows agreement between models
- Could be used for confidence display

## ❌ NOT Currently Supported

### 1. **Peer Comparison** ❌
- No comparison with similar startups
- No percentile rankings
- No industry benchmarking
- No "companies like this" examples

### 2. **Investment Readiness Checklist** ❌
- No structured checklist format
- No priority ordering of issues
- No "complete/warning/incomplete" status

### 3. **Actionable Next Steps** ❌
- No specific action recommendations
- No priority levels for actions
- No "what to do next" guidance

### 4. **Historical Success Examples** ❌
- No similar company exit data
- No success story comparisons
- No time-to-exit predictions

### 5. **Business-Friendly SHAP** ❌
- SHAP values are technical
- Not translated to business language
- No plain English impact descriptions

## 🔧 Implementation Requirements

### Easy to Add (Backend already has data):
1. **Enhanced Risk Display** - Just format existing risk data better
2. **Simplified SHAP** - Translate existing SHAP values
3. **Investment Readiness** - Reformat existing critical failures/thresholds

### Requires Backend Changes:
1. **Peer Comparison** - Need database of comparable companies
2. **Success Examples** - Need historical exit data
3. **Actionable Recommendations** - Need recommendation engine
4. **Industry Benchmarks** - Need industry statistics

## 📊 Current API Response Structure

```python
PredictionResponse:
  - success_probability ✅
  - confidence_interval ✅
  - risk_level ✅
  - key_insights ✅
  - pillar_scores ✅
  - recommendation ✅
  - verdict ✅
  - critical_failures ✅
  - below_threshold ✅
  
AdvancedPredictionResponse (if using unified orchestrator):
  - All above fields ✅
  - risk_factors ✅
  - growth_indicators ✅
  - recommendations ✅ (but generic)
  - model_consensus ✅ (available but should hide)
```

## 🎯 Recommendation

### Can Implement Now with Current Backend:
1. **Enhanced Risk Assessment Display** ✅
   - Use existing risk_level, risk_factors, critical_failures
   - Better visualize the data we already have

2. **Investment Readiness View** ✅
   - Transform critical_failures into checklist
   - Use below_threshold for warnings
   - Use pillar_scores for completed items

3. **Simplified Insights** ✅
   - Translate key_insights to business language
   - Remove technical jargon
   - Focus on implications

4. **Success Probability Context** ✅
   - Use verdict for context
   - Show confidence_interval meaningfully
   - Use stage_thresholds for benchmarking

### Need Backend Updates For:
1. **Peer Comparison** - Requires new data/endpoint
2. **Similar Exit Examples** - Requires historical database
3. **Specific Action Items** - Requires recommendation logic
4. **Industry Benchmarks** - Requires market data

## 💡 Quick Win Strategy

Focus on better presenting what we already have:
- Transform technical data into business insights
- Create compelling visualizations
- Hide technical details (model consensus, SHAP values)
- Emphasize actionable information
