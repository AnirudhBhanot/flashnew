## API Usage

### 1. Get Framework Recommendations
```bash
POST /api/frameworks/recommend
{
  "company_stage": "seed",
  "industry": "fintech",
  "primary_challenge": "finding_product_market_fit",
  "team_size": 10,
  "resources": "limited",
  "timeline": "3-6 months",
  "goals": ["achieve_product_market_fit", "increase_revenue_growth"],
  "current_frameworks": []
}
```

### 2. Generate Implementation Roadmap
```bash
POST /api/frameworks/roadmap
{
  "company_stage": "series_a",
  "industry": "saas",
  "primary_challenge": "scaling_operations",
  "team_size": 50,
  "resources": "moderate",
  "timeline": "6-12 months",
  "goals": ["scale_revenue", "improve_efficiency"]
}
```

### 3. Find Framework Combinations
```bash
POST /api/frameworks/combinations
{
  "company_stage": "growth",
  "industry": "ecommerce",
  "primary_challenge": "market_expansion",
  "goals": ["enter_new_markets", "increase_market_share"]
}
```

### 4. Search Frameworks
```bash
GET /api/frameworks/search?query=lean&category=Innovation&complexity=Intermediate
```

### 5. Get Framework Details
```bash
GET /api/frameworks/framework/Lean%20Startup
```

## Scoring Algorithm

The Framework Intelligence Engine uses a sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm:

1. **Business Stage Alignment (25%)**
   - Matches frameworks to company's current stage
   - Considers resource constraints and capabilities

2. **Challenge Relevance (30%)**
   - Prioritizes frameworks that address specific challenges
   - Uses semantic matching for problem-solution fit

3. **Industry Fit (15%)**
   - Considers industry-specific requirements
   - Adapts recommendations to sector norms

4. **Complexity Match (10%)**
   - Ensures frameworks match team capabilities
   - Considers implementation timeline

5. **Goal Alignment (10%)**
   - Maps frameworks to business objectives
   - Prioritizes outcome-focused frameworks

6. **Time Constraints (5%)**
   - Filters by implementation timeline
   - Considers quick wins vs. long-term strategies

7. **Complementary Frameworks (5%)**
   - Identifies synergistic combinations
   - Avoids redundant recommendations

## Adding New Frameworks

To add a new framework to the database:

```python
new_framework = Framework(
    name="Your Framework Name",
    category="Strategy",
    subcategory="Competitive Analysis",
    description="Comprehensive description...",
    when_to_use="Use this framework when...",
    key_components=["Component 1", "Component 2"],
    steps=[
        "Step 1: Initial assessment",
        "Step 2: Data collection",
        "Step 3: Analysis",
        "Step 4: Implementation"
    ],
    expected_outcomes=["Outcome 1", "Outcome 2"],
    complexity="Intermediate",
    time_to_implement="2-3 months",
    industries=["All"],
    business_stages=["growth", "mature"],
    challenges_addressed=["market_expansion", "competitive_pressure"],
    prerequisites=["Market research capabilities"],
    resources_required=["Analyst team", "Data sources"],
    common_pitfalls=["Over-analysis", "Lack of action"],
    success_metrics=["Market share growth", "Competitive wins"],
    complementary_frameworks=["SWOT Analysis", "Porter's Five Forces"],
    references=["Source 1", "Source 2"]
)

FRAMEWORK_DATABASE.append(new_framework)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Context is Key**
   - Always provide comprehensive context for best recommendations
   - Include specific challenges and constraints

2. **Phased Implementation**
   - Follow the recommended roadmap phases
   - Don't try to implement too many frameworks at once

3. **Measure Success**
   - Track the success metrics for each framework
   - Adjust implementation based on results

4. **Combine Wisely**
   - Use complementary frameworks together
   - Avoid framework overload

5. **Customize for Your Context**
   - Adapt frameworks to your specific situation
   - Don't follow frameworks blindly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Learn from successful implementations
   - Improve recommendations over time

2. **Framework Templates**
   - Downloadable templates for each framework
   - Interactive implementation guides

3. **Success Tracking**
   - Track framework implementation success
   - Build case studies database

4. **Community Contributions**
   - Allow users to submit new frameworks
   - Peer review and validation system

5. **Integration with Tools**
   - Connect with project management tools
   - Automated progress tracking
