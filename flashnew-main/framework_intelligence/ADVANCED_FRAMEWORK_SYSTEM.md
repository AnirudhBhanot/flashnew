# Advanced Framework Intelligence System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive framework selection and customization system that combines MIT's quantitative rigor with HBS's strategic insights. The system intelligently selects, customizes, and sequences business frameworks based on company context.

## Key Components

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Taxonomy (`framework_taxonomy.py`)

**Dimensions:**
- **Temporal Stage**: Pre-formation → Formation → Validation → Traction → Growth → Scale → Maturity
- **Problem Archetype**: Customer Discovery, PMF, Unit Economics, Growth, Competition, etc.
- **Decision Context**: Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive, Evaluative, Exploratory
- **Data Requirements**: Qualitative → Basic Quantitative → Advanced Metrics → Market Data
- **Complexity Tier**: Plug-and-play → Simple → Moderate → Complex → Enterprise
- **Outcome Type**: Strategic Clarity, Tactical Actions, Financial Projections, etc.
- **Industry Context**: Universal, B2B SaaS, Marketplace, FinTech, HealthTech, etc.

### 2. Framework Tagging Database (`framework_tags_database.py`)

Comprehensive metadata for each framework including:
- When to use (temporal stages)
- What problems it solves
- Data requirements
- Expected outcomes
- Effectiveness scores
- Relationships with other frameworks
- Anti-patterns (when NOT to use)

### 3. Advanced Selection Engine (`framework_selection_engine.py`)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```python
fit_score = (
    stage_fit * 0.20 +      # Lifecycle stage match
    problem_fit * 0.30 +    # Problem relevance
    data_fit * 0.15 +       # Data availability
    complexity_fit * 0.10 + # Team capability
    team_fit * 0.10 +       # Team size fit
    timing_fit * 0.15       # Urgency alignment
)
```

**Special Features:**
- Crisis mode prioritization
- Anti-pattern filtering
- Portfolio diversity logic
- Relationship mapping
- Journey planning

### 4. Industry Variants (`industry_framework_variants.py`)

Deep customizations by industry:

**B2B SaaS BCG Matrix:**
- X-axis: Net Revenue Retention (not market share)
- Y-axis: ARR Growth Rate (not market growth)
- Thresholds: 110% NRR, 100% growth

**Marketplace Unit Economics:**
- Dual-sided metrics (seller LTV, buyer LTV)
- Take rate optimization
- Liquidity analysis

**FinTech Compliance:**
- Regulatory risk scoring
- Revenue per user focus
- Compliance cost tracking

### 5. Integrated Selector (`integrated_framework_selector.py`)

Combines all systems into unified API:
- Converts between context formats
- Applies academic selection logic
- Adds industry customizations
- Generates executive reports

## Usage Examples

### Basic Selection
```python
from framework_intelligence.integrated_framework_selector import IntegratedFrameworkSelector
from strategic_context_engine import StrategicContextEngine

# Build context
context_engine = StrategicContextEngine()
context = await context_engine.build_company_context(startup_data)

# Select frameworks
selector = IntegratedFrameworkSelector()
frameworks = selector.select_frameworks(context, max_frameworks=5)
```

### Journey Planning
```python
# Create 12-month framework journey
journey = selector.create_strategic_journey(context, planning_horizon_months=12)

# Access phased recommendations
immediate_frameworks = journey["phases"]["immediate"]
short_term_frameworks = journey["phases"]["short_term"]
critical_path = journey["critical_path"]
```

### Industry Customization
```python
from industry_framework_variants import IndustryFrameworkEngine

engine = IndustryFrameworkEngine()
saas_bcg = engine.get_variant("bcg_matrix", IndustryContext.B2B_SAAS)

# Get custom metrics
nrr_metric = saas_bcg.custom_metrics["net_revenue_retention"]
print(f"Good NRR: {nrr_metric.good_benchmark}%")
```

## Framework Selection Logic

### Stage-Based Hierarchy

1. **Pre-Formation/Formation** (Idea → 6 months)
   - Primary: Jobs-to-be-Done, Customer Development
   - Secondary: Lean Canvas, MVP Framework
   - Avoid: BCG Matrix, Complex financial frameworks

2. **Validation** (6-18 months)
   - Primary: Customer Development, Product-Market Fit
   - Secondary: Unit Economics (basic), Pricing Strategy
   - Avoid: Portfolio analysis, M&A frameworks

3. **Traction** (18-36 months)
   - Primary: Unit Economics, LTV/CAC, AARRR
   - Secondary: Competitive Analysis, Growth Loops
   - Consider: Early strategic frameworks

4. **Growth/Scale** (3-10 years)
   - Primary: BCG Matrix, Ansoff, Porter's
   - Secondary: Blue Ocean, Platform Strategy
   - Full suite available

### Crisis Mode Adjustments

When runway < 6 months or crisis_mode = true:
- Prioritize frameworks with time_to_value < 7 days
- Focus on Unit Economics, Quick Wins
- Boost urgency_score by 30%
- Skip complex strategic frameworks

### Anti-Pattern Detection

Frameworks are filtered out when:
- Team too small (BCG needs 20+ people)
- No revenue (Unit Economics needs data)
- Wrong stage (Portfolio analysis needs multiple products)
- Industry mismatch (Platform strategies for linear businesses)

## Key Innovations

### 1. Academic Rigor
- Quantitative scoring with empirical weights
- Success/failure pattern analysis
- Confidence levels based on data points
- ROI calculations for framework adoption

### 2. Practical Application
- Industry-specific metric definitions
- Custom implementation steps
- Tool requirements specified
- Common pitfall warnings

### 3. Relationship Intelligence
- Prerequisite tracking
- Complementary combinations
- Progressive sequences
- Alternative options

### 4. Contextual Adaptation
- Crisis mode detection
- Fundraising adjustments
- Team size considerations
- Data availability matching
