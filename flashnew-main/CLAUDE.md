  1. **Strategic Context Engine** (`strategic_context_engine.py`):
     - Builds comprehensive company context with industry benchmarks
     - Tracks strategic inflection points (Pre-PMF, PMF, Scaling, etc.)
     - Identifies key challenges and opportunities
  
  2. **Intelligent Framework Selector** (`intelligent_framework_selector.py`):
     - ML-based scoring with context embeddings
     - Industry-specific framework variants (e.g., SaaS BCG uses NRR/ARR instead of market share)
     - Success pattern matching from similar companies
     - Synergy scoring for complementary frameworks
  
  3. **McKinsey-Grade Analyzer** (`mckinsey_grade_analyzer.py`):
     - Generates partner-level strategic analysis
     - Hypothesis trees and scenario planning
     - Monte Carlo simulations for risk analysis
     - Specific, actionable recommendations with metrics
  
  4. **Enhanced Phase 3** (`enhanced_phase3_analyzer.py`):
     - Proper implementation with DeepSeek integration
     - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
     - Implementation roadmap with milestones

  3. Missing `customer_count` field in StartupData model
  4. Frontend expecting different data structures than backend provided
  5. DeepSeek API timeouts when generating complex nested JSON

- **Solution Implemented**: Three-tier approach system
  1. **Decomposed Approach** (`api_michelin_decomposed.py`):
     - Breaks complex analysis into focused API calls
     - Each component uses simple prompts instead of complex JSON
     - Added `get_strategic_priorities` method to fix frontend errors
     - Reliable with graceful fallbacks
  
  2. **Strategic Redesign** (`api_michelin_strategic.py`):

     - Each phase builds on insights from previous phases
     - Generates frontend-compatible structures programmatically
     - Combines reliability with intelligent analysis
  
  3. **Feature Flag System** (`config/features.ts`):
     - Supports switching between `original`, `decomposed`, and `strategic` approaches
     - Allows A/B testing and gradual rollout
     - Currently set to `decomposed` for stability

- **Key Improvements**:
  - Phase-by-phase loading prevents timeouts
  - Strategic context maintains insights across phases
  - Frontend data structure alignment
  - Performance: Phase 1 (~40s), Phase 2 (~35s), Phase 3 (~10s)

## Stage-Aware Financial Modeling Details (V23)

### Pre-Revenue Detection Logic
```python
# In generate_executive_summary(), generate_financial_projections(), etc.
if revenue == 0 and stage in ['pre_seed', 'seed']:
    # Use market-based projections
else:
    # Use traditional revenue-based analysis
```

### Stage-Specific Parameters
```python
# Market capture timeline (months)
timelines = {
    'pre_seed': 36,    # 3 years to meaningful share
    'seed': 24,        # 2 years to meaningful share
    'series_a': 18,    # 1.5 years to meaningful share
    'series_b': 12,    # 1 year to meaningful share
    'series_c': 12,    # 1 year to meaningful share
}

# Target market share (%)
stage_targets = {
    'pre_seed': 0.1,   # 0.1% of SAM
    'seed': 0.5,       # 0.5% of SAM
    'series_a': 1.0,   # 1% of SAM
    'series_b': 5.0,   # 5% of SAM
    'series_c': 10.0,  # 10% of SAM
}

# Valuation multiples
multiples = {
    'pre_seed': 15,    # Higher multiple for early potential
    'seed': 10,        # 10x revenue potential
    'series_a': 8,     # 8x revenue
    'series_b': 6,     # 6x revenue
    'series_c': 4,     # 4x revenue (more mature)
}
```

### Pre-Revenue Strategic Options
1. **Customer Discovery Sprint**: Secure pilot customers in 3 months
2. **MVP to Revenue**: Achieve first revenue milestone in 6-9 months
3. **Strategic Partnership**: Accelerate through channel partnerships

### Pre-Revenue Financial Projections
- Based on % of SAM capture rather than revenue multiples
- Conservative estimates: 0.001% → 0.01% → 0.05% of SAM over 3 years
- Accounts for extended burn period before revenue

### Pre-Revenue Confidence Calculation
```python
confidence_factors = [
    min(100, runway * 100 / 18),              # 18 months runway = 100%
    min(100, team_size * 100 / 10),          # 10 people = 100%
    min(100, domain_expertise * 100 / 10),   # 10 years expertise = 100%
    min(100, (patent_count + prior_exits) * 25),  # Patents/exits worth 25% each
    50 if stage in ['seed', 'series_a'] else 25,  # Stage bonus
]
```
