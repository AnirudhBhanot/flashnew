# Investment Readiness CAMP Update

## Changes Made (May 31, 2025)

### Before
The Investment Readiness checklist showed items in a flat list with hidden CAMP categories:
- ❌ Financial health
- ⚠️ Competitive advantage
- ✅ Market opportunity
- ❌ Team strength

### After
Items are now grouped by CAMP categories with clear headers:

```
💰 Capital

─────────────────────────────
  ⚠️ Financial health - Adequate but needs improvement
  ❌ Runway - Less than 12 months runway remaining

🚀 Advantage  
Competitive Moat & Differentiation
─────────────────────────────
  ✅ Competitive moat - Strong differentiation and defensibility
  ✅ Technical differentiation - Patent-pending technology

📊 Market
TAM Size & Growth Dynamics
─────────────────────────────
  ⚠️ Market opportunity - Decent market size and growth
  ✅ Customer traction - Growing MRR and user base

👥 People
Team Strength & Experience  
─────────────────────────────
  ❌ Team strength - Key hires needed [high priority]
  ❌ Advisory board - Industry expertise lacking [high priority]
```
