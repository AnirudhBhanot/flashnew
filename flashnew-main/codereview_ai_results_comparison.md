# CodeReview AI - Results Comparison

## Company Profile
**CodeReview AI** - Pre-seed AI startup building automated code review tools
- $150K raised, 8 months runway
- 2 founders, 0 customers, $0 revenue
- Prototype stage, 20+ competitors

## Old System (Fantasy Models) vs New System (Realistic Models)

### Old System Would Show:
```
Success Probability: 38-42%
Verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS
CAMP Scores: All exactly 50%
Confidence: HIGH (false confidence)
Message: "Above average for pre-seed!"
```

### New System Shows:
```
Success Probability: 34.7%
Verdict: PASS (but medium strength)
CAMP Scores: 45-53% (poor discrimination)
Confidence: LOW (honest uncertainty)
Disclaimer: "Early-stage prediction is highly uncertain"
```

## Key Differences:

### 1. **Probability Interpretation**
- **Old**: 38% seemed "good" because models were poorly calibrated
- **New**: 34.7% is actually above the 16% baseline (positive signal)

### 2. **CAMP Analysis**
- **Old**: All pillars at exactly 50% (no information)
- **New**: Slight variation (45-53%) shows People slightly stronger

### 3. **Confidence Level**
- **Old**: High confidence despite poor models
- **New**: Low confidence reflecting true uncertainty

### 4. **User Experience**
- **Old**: "We can predict your success!"
- **New**: "Success is uncertain, here's what we see..."

## What This Means:

The realistic models show that for a typical pre-seed:
- **Quantitative metrics provide limited signal**
- **34.7% is actually encouraging** (2x the baseline 16%)
- **People quality matters most** at this stage
- **Execution will determine outcome** more than metrics

## Investment Decision:

With realistic models, the focus shifts from "prediction" to "assessment":
- ✅ Team has relevant experience
- ⚠️ Market is crowded (20+ competitors)
- ⚠️ No unique advantage yet
- ❓ Success depends on execution quality

**Recommendation**: Worth deeper diligence on team quality and go-to-market strategy, but recognize high uncertainty at this stage.
