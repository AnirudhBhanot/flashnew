- **User Growth**: Month-over-month growth rates
- **Early Revenue**: Even small amounts ($150k ARR for Buffer)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost** (CAC)

- Show current alternatives are inadequate

**Solution Presentation:**
- Direct connection to stated problem
- Simple explanation of how it works
- Clear benefits over status quo

### Examples:
- **Airbnb**: "Price is an important concern for customers booking travel online" → "A web platform where users can rent out their space to host travelers"

### Failed Patterns
- Long bios
- Irrelevant credentials
- Missing key roles (especially CTO for tech startups)
- Too many team members listed

## Key Differentiators: Successful vs Failed Pitches

### Successful Pitches

   - Minimal text per slide

4. **Specific Use of Funds**
   - Tied to concrete milestones
   - Clear ROI for investors

5. **Preparation and Practice**
   - Well-rehearsed delivery
   - Anticipate investor questions

### Failed Pitches

   - Try to explain everything

2. **Weak Problem Definition**
   - Start with technology or market dynamics
   - Unclear why solution is needed

3. **Missing Business Model**

## VC Decision Factors

### What VCs Spend Time On

- **Business Model**: Path to returns
- **Competition**: Market understanding

### Time Constraints
- Average VC spends **3 minutes 20 seconds** on a deck
- Decision often made in first 30 seconds
- Must grab attention immediately

### Investment Thesis Alignment

- Team must show ability to execute
- Clear unfair advantage
- Timing must be right

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Keep it Simple**: 10-14 slides maximum
2. **Lead with Traction**: If you have it, feature it prominently
3. **Tell a Story**: Clear narrative from problem to solution
4. **Be Specific**: Use real numbers, concrete examples
5. **Show, Don't Tell**: Visual evidence over claims
6. **Practice Relentlessly**: Know every slide by heart
7. **Target Right**: Research investors before pitching

## Statistical Reality

- Only 1 out of 100 companies succeed in fundraising
- 86% failure rate in Seed round alone
- VCs respond to ~10% of decks
- VCs invest in <1% of companies they see

Success requires exceptional preparation, clear communication, and strong evidence of traction or potential.
