# Michelin API JSON Parsing Fixes Summary

## Issue
The DeepSeek API was returning truncated JSON responses that were failing to parse, with errors occurring around 3000 characters.

## Root Causes
1. **Low max_tokens limit**: The API was configured with a max_tokens limit of 4000, which was insufficient for comprehensive strategic analysis responses
2. **No graceful error handling**: When JSON parsing failed, the entire request would fail with no fallback
3. **Complex prompts**: The prompts were requesting very detailed responses that exceeded token limits

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Token Limits
- Changed default max_tokens from 4000 to 8000 for most API calls
- Added explicit max_tokens parameter to all DeepSeek API calls
- Added reminder in system prompts to return valid, complete JSON

### 2. Improved JSON Extraction Logic
- Enhanced `_extract_json_from_response` method with better truncation detection
- Added intelligent repair for truncated JSON:
  - Counts unclosed braces, brackets, and quotes
  - Removes trailing commas before closing
  - Adds missing closing characters in the correct order
- Added detailed logging for debugging (response length, last 500 chars)

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- If JSON parsing completely fails, returns a minimal valid response structure
- Includes error information and partial response for debugging
- Prevents complete API failure when responses are truncated

### 4. Graceful Degradation in Analysis
- Added error checking in `analyze_startup` method
- If Phase 1 parsing fails, uses a default structure to continue analysis
- Ensures API always returns a valid response, even if degraded

### 5. Prompt Optimization
- Modified prompts to request "concise but insightful" responses
- Reduced number of required items in lists (e.g., 3 â†’ 2 initiatives)
- Changed prompt format from "Format your response as..." to "Return ONLY a JSON object..."

## Files Modified
- `/Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/api_michelin_llm_analysis.py`: Main fixes applied here
- `/Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/api_server_unified.py`: Added import for the fixed router

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify:
- `test_json_parsing.py`: Tests the improved JSON parsing logic
- `test_michelin_fix.py`: Tests the full API endpoint

## Result
The API now handles truncated responses gracefully:
- Attempts to repair truncated JSON automatically
- Falls back to a minimal valid structure if repair fails
- Always returns a valid response to the client
- Provides better error logging for debugging

## Usage
The fixed Michelin API is now available at:
```
POST /api/michelin/analyze
```

With the same request structure as before, but now with improved reliability and error handling.
