# DeepSeek API Integration Test Report

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Platform:** FLASH  
**API Server:** Running on port 8001

## Executive Summary

The DeepSeek API integration in the FLASH platform is **partially working**. Out of 5 tested endpoints, 2 are successfully using DeepSeek API for AI-generated content, while 3 are falling back to pre-defined responses. The API key is properly configured, but caching and fallback mechanisms are reducing the actual DeepSeek usage.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Endpoints (Using DeepSeek)

1. **Deep Framework Analysis** (`/api/frameworks/deep-analysis`)
   - Status: Working correctly with DeepSeek
   - Response Time: 35.3 seconds
   - Evidence: Generates comprehensive strategic analysis with AI insights
   - Log Entry: "Enhanced analysis with DeepSeek insights"

2. **What-If Analysis** (`/api/analysis/whatif/dynamic`)
   - Status: Working correctly with DeepSeek
   - Response Time: 10.6 seconds
   - Evidence: Creates AI-generated scenario narratives
   - Log Entry: "DeepSeek API response status: 200"

### ⚠️ Fallback Endpoints (Not Using DeepSeek)

1. **Dynamic Recommendations** (`/api/analysis/recommendations/dynamic`)
   - Status: Using fallback mode
   - Response Time: 18.1 seconds (likely due to other processing)
   - Issue: Returns pre-defined structure instead of AI-generated content
   - Possible Cause: Cache hit or fallback trigger

2. **Market Insights** (`/api/analysis/insights/market`)
   - Status: Using fallback mode
   - Response Time: 3.3ms (too fast for API call)
   - Issue: Cache hit preventing fresh API call
   - Log Entry: "Cache hit for llm:market_insights"

3. **Competitor Analysis** (`/api/analysis/competitors/analyze`)
   - Status: Using enhanced fallback mode
   - Response Time: 5.3ms (too fast for API call)
   - Issue: Explicitly using fallback implementation
   - Log Entry: "Using enhanced fallback competitor analysis"

## Performance Metrics

- **DeepSeek API Average Response Time:** 22.9 seconds
  - Min: 10.6s, Max: 35.3s
- **Fallback Average Response Time:** 6.0 seconds
  - Min: 3.3ms, Max: 18.1s

## Backend Log Analysis

### Recent DeepSeek Activity
- ✅ API calls are being made successfully
- ✅ Receiving 200 status responses
- ✅ Content is being generated (1138-1655 bytes)

### Issues Identified
1. **Caching:** Market insights are being cached, preventing fresh API calls
2. **Fallback Logic:** Competitor analysis always uses fallback
3. **Response Format:** Recommendations endpoint returning fallback structure

## Configuration Status

- ✅ **API Key:** Properly configured in .env file
- ✅ **Server Running:** API server active on port 8001
- ✅ **Connection:** DeepSeek API endpoint reachable
- ⚠️ **Cache TTL:** May be too aggressive (default 3600 seconds)

## Recommendations

1. **Clear Cache**: Clear Redis cache to force fresh API calls
   ```bash
   redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

2. **Review Fallback Logic**: Check why competitor analysis always uses fallback
   - File: `llm_analysis.py`
   - Look for conditions triggering fallback mode

3. **Adjust Cache TTL**: Consider reducing cache duration for testing
   ```python
   CACHE_TTL = int(os.getenv("LLM_CACHE_TTL", 300))  # 5 minutes instead of 1 hour
   ```

4. **Fix Recommendations Format**: Ensure recommendations endpoint returns DeepSeek structure
   - Check parsing logic in `api_llm_endpoints.py`

5. **Monitor API Usage**: Track DeepSeek API calls vs cache hits
   - Consider adding metrics for API usage monitoring

## Conclusion

The DeepSeek API integration is functional but underutilized due to aggressive caching and fallback mechanisms. With the recommended adjustments, all 5 endpoints should properly utilize DeepSeek for AI-generated content, providing more dynamic and personalized analysis for users.
