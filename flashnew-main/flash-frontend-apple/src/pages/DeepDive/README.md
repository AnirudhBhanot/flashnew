# Progressive Deep Dive System

## Overview
The Progressive Deep Dive is a comprehensive strategic analysis system that guides startups through four phases of in-depth assessment, helping them understand their position, align their strategy, prepare their organization, and plan for multiple futures.

## Architecture

### Phase Structure

#### Phase 1: Context Mapping
**Purpose**: Understand your current position from both external and internal perspectives.

**Components**:
1. **External Reality Check** (`ExternalReality.tsx`)
   - Porter's Five Forces analysis
   - Industry rivalry assessment
   - Customer and supplier power evaluation
   - Threat analysis from substitutes and new entrants
   - Overall market opportunity scoring

2. **Internal Audit** (`InternalAudit.tsx`)
   - Deep CAMP framework analysis
   - Capital efficiency metrics
   - Competitive advantage assessment
   - Market position evaluation
   - People and team strength analysis
   - Capability gap identification

#### Phase 2: Strategic Alignment
**Purpose**: Align your vision with reality and plan growth strategies.

**Components**:
1. **Vision-Reality Gap** (`VisionRealityGap.tsx`)
   - Vision clarity assessment
   - Current reality evaluation across 8 dimensions
   - Gap analysis and visualization
   - Bridging strategies with timelines
   - Risk assessment for vision achievement

2. **Ansoff Matrix** (`AnsoffMatrix.tsx`)
   - Four-quadrant growth strategy analysis
   - Resource allocation planning
   - Risk-return assessment
   - Success probability estimation
   - Strategic recommendations per quadrant

#### Phase 3: Organizational Readiness
**Purpose**: Assess organizational alignment using the McKinsey 7S Framework.

**Components**:
1. **7S Framework** (`SevenSFramework.tsx`)
   - Strategy alignment
   - Structure effectiveness
   - Systems efficiency
   - Shared values and culture
   - Leadership style assessment
   - Staff capabilities evaluation
   - Skills gap analysis
   - Current vs. desired state comparison

#### Phase 4: Risk-Weighted Pathways
**Purpose**: Plan for multiple futures using scenario planning and probabilistic analysis.

**Components**:
1. **Scenario Planning** (`ScenarioPlanning.tsx`)
   - Best, base, and worst case scenarios
   - Probability assignments
   - Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations)
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Decision tree analysis
   - Contingency planning
   - Financial projections per scenario

### Synthesis
**Purpose**: Bring together all insights into actionable strategic recommendations.

**Components**:
- Executive summary with strategic readiness score
- Top 5 priorities ranked by impact and feasibility
- Implementation roadmap with timelines
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Multi-dimensional assessment visualization

## Data Persistence

All components use localStorage for data persistence:
- `externalRealityData`: Porter's Five Forces assessment
- `internalAuditData`: CAMP deep dive results
- `visionRealityGapData`: Vision and reality assessments
- `ansoffMatrixData`: Growth strategy allocations
- `sevenSFrameworkData`: 7S assessment scores
- `scenarioPlanningData`: Scenarios and simulations

   - Adjust strategies based on results

## Component Documentation

### Common Props

Most components accept:
- `companyId?: string` - For multi-company support
- `onComplete?: () => void` - Completion callback
- `initialData?: any` - Pre-populate with existing data

### Styling

All components use:
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Consistent design system variables
- Responsive breakpoints
- Print-optimized styles

### State Management

- Local component state for UI interactions
- localStorage for data persistence
- No global state dependencies
