## Usage

The new Review page automatically integrates with the existing wizard flow:

3. Progressive disclosure allows drilling into specific sections
4. Confirmation dialog ensures intentional submission
5. Seamless transition to the analysis/results page

## Design Philosophy

Following Johnny Ive's design principles:
- **Simplicity**: Remove everything unnecessary
- **Clarity**: Information hierarchy is immediately apparent
- **Deference**: The interface gets out of the way of the content
- **Depth**: Subtle animations and layers create dimensionality
- **Delight**: Small details like hover states and transitions feel premium

The redesigned Review page completes the Johnny Ive aesthetic throughout the entire assessment flow, providing a cohesive, premium experience from start to finish.
