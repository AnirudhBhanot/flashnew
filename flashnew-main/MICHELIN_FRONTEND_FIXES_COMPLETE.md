# Michelin Strategic Analysis - Frontend Integration Fixes

## All Frontend Errors Resolved ✅

### Error 1: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')
**Cause**: API returned `bcg_matrix_analysis` but frontend expected `bcg_matrix`
**Fix**: Changed field name and structure to match frontend expectations

### Error 2: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map') - Phase 1
**Cause**: Missing `strategic_priorities` array in SWOT analysis
**Fix**: Added `strategic_priorities` field with 5 strategic items

### Error 3: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map') - Phase 2
**Cause**: Missing `risks` array in growth scenarios and wrong data types
**Fix**: 
- Added `risks` array to each growth scenario
- Changed `investment_required` from string to number
- Changed `revenue_projection_3y` to `revenue_projection_3yr` (matching frontend)
- Changed `probability_of_success` from string to number

### Error 4: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map') - Phase 3
**Cause**: Multiple structure mismatches in Phase 3
**Fix**:
- Changed `implementation_overview` to `implementation_roadmap_summary`
- Changed `okr_framework` from object to array with `quarter` field
- Added proper structure for `key_results` with `kr`, `current`, and `target` fields
- Changed `resource_requirements` to have arrays for `human_resources`, `technology_resources`, and `partnership_resources`
- Changed `risk_mitigation_plan` from object to array
- Changed `probability` to `likelihood` in risks
- Added `mitigation_strategy` and `contingency_plan` fields to risks
- Added `type` and `frequency` fields to `success_metrics`
