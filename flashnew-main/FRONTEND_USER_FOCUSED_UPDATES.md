# Frontend Updates Based on User Research

## 🎯 What Users Actually Want (Not Model Details!)

### Research Findings
Users care about **outcomes over algorithms**. They want:
- ✅ Actionable insights
- ✅ Clear risk assessment
- ✅ Peer comparisons
- ✅ Speed and accuracy
- ❌ NOT technical model details
- ❌ NOT training statistics

## 📊 Recommended Frontend Updates

### 1. **Enhanced Risk Assessment Display** 🚨
Instead of showing model contributions, focus on:
```typescript
// What users see
<RiskAssessment>
  <RiskScore level="medium" score={6.5} />
  <TopRisks>
    • High burn rate vs revenue (23 months runway)
    • Strong competition from 3 funded competitors
    • Limited patent protection
  </TopRisks>
  <MitigationStrategies>
    • Consider strategic partnerships
    • Focus on customer retention (current: 72%)
  </MitigationStrategies>
</RiskAssessment>
```

### 2. **Peer Comparison Section** 📈
Users want benchmarking:
```typescript
<PeerComparison>
  <h3>How {startup} Compares</h3>
  <Percentile score={78} label="Top 22% in AI/ML sector" />
  <ComparisonChart>
    // Show vs similar Series A companies
    - Revenue Growth: Above average (+25%)
    - Team Strength: Top quartile
    - Market Timing: Optimal
  </ComparisonChart>
</PeerComparison>
```

### 3. **Investment Readiness Checklist** ✓
Actionable next steps:
```typescript
<InvestmentReadiness>
  <ChecklistItem status="complete">
    Strong founding team (8.5/10)
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem status="warning">
    Revenue growth needs improvement (current: 250% YoY, target: 300%+)
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem status="incomplete">
    Missing: Clear competitive moat documentation
  </ChecklistItem>
</InvestmentReadiness>
```

### 4. **Success Probability with Context** 🎯
Not just a number, but what it means:
```typescript
<SuccessPrediction>
  <Probability>75.3%</Probability>
  <Context>
    Similar to successful exits like:
    • Company A (acquired for $500M)
    • Company B (IPO at $2B valuation)
  </Context>
  <TimeHorizon>
    Most likely exit: 3-5 years
  </TimeHorizon>
</SuccessPrediction>
```

### 5. **Quick Actions Dashboard** ⚡
What to do next:
```typescript
<QuickActions>
  <ActionCard priority="high">
    Schedule deep dive on technology differentiation
  </ActionCard>
  <ActionCard priority="medium">
    Request updated financial projections
  </ActionCard>
  <ActionCard priority="low">
    Monitor competitor funding announcements
  </ActionCard>
</QuickActions>
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Add

### Skip These Technical Details:
- ❌ Model accuracy percentages (77.17% AUC)
- ❌ Training time (56 seconds)
- ❌ Model consensus scores
- ❌ Individual model contributions
- ❌ "No placeholders" badges
- ❌ Technical architecture details

### Why? User Research Shows:
- VCs want insights, not algorithms
- Technical details reduce trust ("trying too hard")
- Focus should be on business value
- Simplicity drives adoption

## ✅ What to Keep/Improve

### 1. **SHAP Explanations** - But Business Focused
```typescript
// Instead of: "monthly_burn_usd: -150000 (SHAP: -0.23)"
// Show: "High burn rate is the biggest risk factor, reducing success probability by 15%"
```

### 2. **Confidence Intervals** - With Context
```typescript
// Instead of: "Confidence: [71%, 79%]"
// Show: "High confidence prediction (±4%) based on similar companies"
```

### 3. **CAMP Scores** - With Benchmarks
```typescript
// Instead of just: "Capital: 72/100"
// Show: "Capital: 72/100 (Better than 65% of Series A companies)"
```

## 🎨 Visual Priority Changes

### Focus On:
1. **Clean, executive-friendly dashboards**
2. **Comparison visualizations**
3. **Risk heat maps**
4. **Growth trajectory charts**
5. **Market positioning graphics**

### Remove/Hide:
1. Model performance metrics
2. Technical confidence scores
3. Algorithm details
4. Training statistics

## 📱 New Page Recommendations

### 1. **Portfolio Overview** (New)
- Track multiple assessments
- Compare companies side-by-side
- Export reports for partners

### 2. **Market Intelligence** (New)
- Sector trends based on assessments
- Emerging opportunities
- Risk patterns by industry

### 3. **Due Diligence Checklist** (Enhance existing)
- AI-powered question generation
- Document request lists
- Red flag alerts

## 🔑 Key Principle

**Show VALUE, not VALIDITY**

Users assume the AI works. They don't need proof of "real models" or accuracy stats. They need:
- Clear insights
- Actionable recommendations  
- Time savings
- Better investment decisions

## 📝 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Business Value (Do First)
1. Enhance risk assessment display
2. Add peer comparisons
3. Improve actionable insights
4. Simplify SHAP explanations

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration
1. Portfolio tracking
2. Export capabilities
3. Alert system
4. Collaboration features

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
1. Market trends
2. Sector analysis
3. Pattern recognition
4. Predictive alerts

**Bottom Line**: Users trust results through business value, not technical prowess. Focus on making their investment decisions easier, faster, and more informed - not on proving the AI is sophisticated.
