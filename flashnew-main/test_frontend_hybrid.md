# Testing Frontend Integration with Hybrid System

## Setup

1. **Start the Complete Hybrid API Server**
```bash
cd /Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH
python3 api_server_complete_hybrid.py
```

2. **Start the Frontend**
```bash
cd /Users/sf/Desktop/FLASH/flash-frontend
npm start
```

## What's New

### Enhanced Analysis Page
- Shows "Analyzing with 29 Specialized Models"
- Progress through 7 phases of analysis
- Displays model count and accuracy info

### Hybrid Results Page
- **Overview Tab**: 
  - Success probability with color coding
  - CAMP framework scores with radar chart
  - Model confidence analysis showing all 5 model types
  - Key insights from the analysis

- **Model Analysis Tab**:
  - Breakdown of all 29 models
  - Shows predictions from each model category
  - Explains the weight of each model type

- **Patterns Tab**:
  - Dominant patterns detected (e.g., Efficient Growth, Market Leader)
  - Stage fit assessment (Strong/Moderate/Weak)
  - Industry fit assessment
  - Pattern descriptions and implications

- **Recommendations Tab**:
  - Actionable recommendations based on analysis
  - CAMP-specific improvements
  - Targeted suggestions for weak areas

## Features to Test

1. **Data Collection**: Enter startup data and submit
2. **Analysis Process**: Watch the enhanced progress animation
3. **Results Display**: Check all 4 tabs work properly
4. **Model Breakdown**: Verify 5 model types show predictions
5. **Pattern Detection**: See if patterns are identified
6. **Recommendations**: Check if recommendations are relevant

## Expected Behavior

- Analysis should take ~10 seconds
- Results should show:
  - Final probability (combined from all models)
  - Confidence score (based on model agreement)
  - Verdict (PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL)
  - Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
  - CAMP scores
  - Pattern insights
  - Stage and industry fit
  - Specific recommendations

## Visual Enhancements

- Dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- Animated progress bars
- Color-coded scores (green > 70%, blue > 50%, orange > 30%, red < 30%)
- Model icons for each type
- Smooth transitions between tabs

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Check both servers are running
2. Verify port 8001 for API
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure all 29 models loaded in API
