# Results Page Cleanup Summary

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Task:** Remove low-value analyses and promotional content from Results page to focus on core insights

## Analyses Removed

Based on value assessment for founders, the following analyses were removed:

1. **Comparative Analysis** - Less actionable, founders can get this from other sources
2. **What-If Scenarios** - Complex and less immediately useful
3. **Market Insights** - Generic information available elsewhere
4. **Competitor Analysis** - Had JSON parsing issues, fallback data less valuable
5. **Progressive Deep Dive Promotional Section** - Removed promotional content between FLASH Executive Report and Recommended Actions

## Analyses Retained

The high-value analyses that remain:

1. **Success Score** - Core metric founders need
2. **CAMP Framework Analysis** - Foundation of the assessment
3. **Enhanced Insights** - Key takeaways from the analysis
4. **Deep Dive Analysis** - Comprehensive strategic insights
5. **FLASH Intelligence** (formerly LLM Recommendations) - Most actionable, specific next steps
6. **Strategic Framework Analysis** - AI-selected frameworks
7. **FLASH Executive Report** - McKinsey-quality strategic analysis

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/pages/Results/ResultsV2Enhanced.tsx`
- Removed 4 ExpandableSection components
- Removed 4 unused imports
- Cleaned up component structure

### 2. `/src/components/ResultsV2Enhanced.tsx`
- Updated analysisSections array to remove 4 analyses
- Removed switch cases for removed analyses
- Removed 4 unused imports
- Updated "LLM Recommendations" title to "FLASH Intelligence"

### 3. `/src/pages/Results/index.tsx`
- Removed 4 sections from reveal animation sequence
- Removed 4 component renders
- Removed 4 unused imports
- Updated comment to "FLASH Intelligence"

### 4. `/src/pages/Results/ResultsV2Enhanced.module.scss`

- Cleaned up unused styles for .progressiveDeepDiveSection and .deepDiveButton

## Benefits

1. **Improved Focus**: Results page now emphasizes the most valuable insights
2. **Faster Load Time**: Fewer components to render and API calls to make
   - Removed promotional content that was distracting from core results
3. **Cleaner UX**: Less overwhelming for founders
4. **Better DeepSeek Integration**: Removed problematic competitor analysis endpoint
5. **Aligned with Value**: Top analyses (Recommendations + Deep Framework) get prominence

## Technical Notes

- Build compiles successfully with only warnings (no errors)
- All TypeScript imports cleaned up
- No breaking changes to other components
- Progressive Deep Dive system remains intact
- API endpoints still available if needed in future

## Next Steps

If needed in future:
1. These analyses could be moved to an "Advanced Insights" tab
2. Could be offered as premium features
3. Components remain in codebase and can be re-enabled easily

The Results page is now streamlined to deliver maximum value with minimal complexity.
